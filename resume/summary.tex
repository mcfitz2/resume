Current Software Engineer at VMware, working primarily on VMware Cloud Foundation. I am well rounded engineer with experience in automation, data sourcing/transformation, frontend and backend development in several languages. I am an effective communicator with strong soft skills. 

My true passion is problem solving. Whether it's scaling a distributed system, making a chair that doesn't rock, or getting a 40 year old engine running, I have the skills to get it done.
